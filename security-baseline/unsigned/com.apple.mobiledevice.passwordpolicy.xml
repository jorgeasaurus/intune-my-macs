  <Name>CIS Level 2 - Password Policy</Name>
  <Description>Enforces strong password requirements for macOS user accounts. This CIS Level 2 security baseline control implements comprehensive password complexity: minimum 15 characters, at least 1 complex character, custom regex requiring uppercase, lowercase, and numeric characters. Security controls include maximum 5 failed attempts before lockout, 15-minute lockout reset period, and 365-day maximum password age. These settings protect against brute force attacks, password guessing, and credential compromise while ensuring regular password rotation.</Description>
